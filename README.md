This project was originally my final exam for the course Object-Oriented Computational Thinking. I failed the exam after overestimating my preparation; however, I did not want to leave the topic unfinished. I asked my professor for the exam instructions and reviewed the necessary concepts to properly work with object-oriented programming in C++.
